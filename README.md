# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
In this project, we used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We have trained and validated a model so that it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
